# NaCl Data
Here you will find the NaCl data held by zincware.
Each sub-directory will have its own readme explaining exactly what is inside but here
you will find some brief overviews.

* ds_1: Contains short classical NaCl md simulations at 1400 K stored as extxyz.
* ds_2: Contains short NaCl DFT data in extxyz format.
* ds_3: Contains 1000 atom simulation data in lammpstraj format with charges and
  velocities. This data is sampled every time step and is therefore applicable for
  Green-Kubo analysis.
* ds_4: Contains 1000 atom data in lammpstraj format sampled every time step but 
  without charges or box indices.
* Contains 1000 atom simulation data in lammpstraj format with charges and box indices.
  This data is sampled every 100 time steps and therefore is suitable more for Einstein
  analysis.
